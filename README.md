# Pomodoro_Timer
-- Message from the creator --

#this is my first personal project so maybe there will be 
 flaws and bugs in the code. So i really appreciate if 
 you can give me feedback or tell me if there is bug 
 in the code. 

#and also if you have a cool idea to develop this project
 just let me know and maybe we can make it together.

#if there is any question, feel free to reach me out through
 email at: wayansugiana777@gmail.com


-- Note --

#you can add audio file for the alarm at timer.html file.
 all you need to do is change the audio path inside the audio
 tags to your currently audio file path. 
 -> * Recommendation: you can put your audio file inside the
      resource folder so it will be more neat.
